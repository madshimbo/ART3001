    <p>You give the mushrooms to the troll, who gobbles them down instantly. You watch him clutch his throat and collapse to the ground. The troll is dead. You pass by him and continue over the bridge. Just past the bridge, you see a light through the trees. An exit?? You run ahead and have successfully made it out of the garden.

        Congratulations!
