    <h2>Don't Quit
        by
        John Greenleaf Whittier</h2>
        <br>
           <br>  <p>
        When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
        When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,
        When the funds are low and the debts are high
        And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
        When care is pressing you down a bit,
        Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
        Life is strange with its twists and turns
        As every one of us sometimes learns
        And many a failure comes about
        When he might have won had he stuck it out;
        Don't give up though the pace seems slow—
        You may succeed with another blow.
        Success is failure turned inside out—
        The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
        And you never can tell just how close you are,
        It may be near when it seems so far;
        So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—
        It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.</p>
