    <h1>Don't Quit
        by
        John Greenleaf Whittier</h1>
        <br>
           <p>When things go <span style="color:red;">wrong</span> as they <i>sometimes</i> will, <br>
        When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,<br>
        When the funds are <span style="color:red;">low</span> and the debts are high<br>
        And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br>
        When care is <span style="color:red;">pressing</span> you down a bit,<br>
        Rest if you must, but don't you <span style="color:red;">quit</span>.<br>
        Life is strange with its twists and turns<br>
        As every one of us sometimes learns<br>
        And many a <span style="color:red;">failure</span> comes about<br>
        When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>
        Don't give up though the pace seems <span style="color:red;">slow</span><br>
        You may succeed with another blow.<br>
        Success is <span style="color:red;">failure</span> turned inside out—<br>
        The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>
        And you never can tell just how close you are,<br>
        It may be near when it seems so <span style="color:red;">far</span>;<br>
        So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—<br>
        It's when things seem <span style="color:red;">worst</span> that you must not quit.</p>
