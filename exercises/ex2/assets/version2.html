    <h1>Don't Quit
        by
        John Greenleaf Whittier</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left">When things go wrong as they sometimes will, </p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"> When the funds are low and the debts are high</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left">And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> When care is pressing you down a bit,</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"> Rest if you must, but don't you quit.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left">Life is strange with its twists and turns</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> As every one of us sometimes learns</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"> And many a failure comes about</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left">When he might have won had he stuck it out;</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> Don't give up though the pace seems slow—</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"> You may succeed with another blow.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left">Success is failure turned inside out—</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"> And you never can tell just how close you are,</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left">It may be near when it seems so far;</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"> It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.</p>
