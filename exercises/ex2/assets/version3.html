    <h1>Don't Quit
        by
        John Greenleaf Whittier</h1>
        <br>
           <br>  
           <p>
        When things go wrong as they sometimes will, <br>
        When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,<br>
        When the funds are LOW and the debts are HIGH<br>
        And you want to SMILE, but you have to SIGH,<br>
        When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>
        Rest if you must, but don't you quit.<br>
        Life is strange with its T W I S T S and T U R N S<br>
        As every one of us sometimes learns<br>
        And many a failure comes about<br>
        When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>
        DON'T GIVE UP though the pace seems slow—<br>
        You may succeed with another blow.<br>
        Success is failure turned inside out—<br>
        The silver tint of the clouds of DOUBT,<br>
        And you never can tell just how close you are,<br>
        It may be near when it seems so far;<br>
        So stick to the F I G H T when you're hardest hit—<br>
        It's when things seem worst that you <u>must</u> <u>not</u> <u>quit</u>.</p>
