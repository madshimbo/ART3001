    <p>Don't Quit <br>
        by<br>
        <u>John Greenleaf Whittier</u>
        <br>
           <br>  <br>
        When things go wrong as they sometimes will, <br>
        When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,<br><br>
        When the funds are low and the debts are high<br>
        And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br><br>
        When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>
        Rest if you must, but <b>don't you quit.</b><br><br>
        Life is strange with its twists and turns<br>
        As every one of us sometimes learns<br><br>
        And many a failure comes about<br>
        When he might have won had he <b>stuck it out;</b><br><br>
        <b>Don't give up</b> though the pace seems slow—<br>
        You may succeed with another blow.<br><br>
        Success is failure turned inside out—<br>
        The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br><br>
        And you never can tell just how close you are,<br>
        It may be near when it seems so far;<br><br>
        So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—<br>
        It's when things seem worst that you <b>must not quit.</b></p>
