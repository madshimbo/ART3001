    <h1>Seeing Things Come to Life</h1>

    <p>HOW THIS CLASS IS OPENING DOORS FOR ME</p>
    <p>This week of class has gotten me extremely excited about the possibilities of HTML. Like some others have said, having taken other coding classes before, HTML seems incredibly easy to learn so far. I also love the instant gratification that you receive in seeing your edits come to life in the live server area. This makes it so much easier to know if you’re making the edits that you actually want to make.  </p>

    <p>This is the first time that I have had a visual interface along with my code. Most of my previous classes have just been text in the terminal or program. The possibilities of changing the view of that text and adding in designs and pictures is very intriguing to me and I find myself wanting to be working on my site outside of class time and experimenting with different things myself. </p>
    <p>This is also the first time I have been able to combine two of my passions: technology and art. Before, it was very much one-sided. I was either in a coding class or an art class. This class is what I’ve been looking for for a while now. I always told people that I wanted to be able to combine art and technology somehow and this is the first time that I’ve been convinced that it can really happen. </p>

    <p>I have also just moved across the country to start a new job at a startup company. Being in such a technology-focused and fast-paced environment, learning HTML is proving to be quite relevant and useful. It helps me understand some of the things that my co-workers are always talking about. I’ve also been talking about this class with my managers and they’ve been quite enthusiastic about me working with tech and design at the company in the future.</p>
    <p>In all the craziness lately, it has been hard for me to meet assignment deadlines and have enough time to put in the work and ideas that I would like to. This is especially disappointing as most of my classes are very interesting and relevant to me. </p>
    <p>Lastly, I appreciate the way this class is being taught. Most of my other coding-focused classes have jumped right into lectures about the language rather than guiding students step-by-step through the actual coding. I am very much a visual and physical learner, so being able to see things in live-time and perform them on my own has been incredibly helpful and makes it easier to do individual assignments later. </p>
    <p>I am coming out of this week feeling hopeful and inspired, but ultimately wish I had more time to explore all the possibilities with HTML. </p>
