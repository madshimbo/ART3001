    <h1>Opening Up</h1>
    <p>March 21, 2021</p>
    <p><u>For the first time, I think I am starting to catch a glimpse of what San Francisco is typically like.</u></p>
    <p>When I first moved to California from Ohio, I knew I was in for a rude awakening when it came to COVID restrictions. In Ohio, I had been used to being able to eat indoors and go places for quite some time. Once I got here, I quickly realized that this was not the case. The restrictions were so intense that even outdoor dining was not allowed.
    </p>
    <p>As time moved on, outdoor dining opened and then just recently some indoor dining has been allowed. I’ve slowly seen more and more people around the city and restaurants become busier and busier.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, I was sitting in Washington Square Park eating a pastry from an Italian bakery noticing how many people were sitting in the park. There was live music and people were picnicking and I even saw a double decker tour bus pass by. That’s how I know things are really coming back – the tourism is returning. My boyfriend was even able to get a job as a Segway tour guide. I am taking this as a sign that life is returning to San Francisco and let me tell you, I am excited for it.
    </p>
    <p>There are so many things that I’ve been wanting to do and see in San Francisco that have been closed due to COVID. Here’s hoping that I will be able to do all those things. Will keep you updated.
