    <h1>Finnigan</h1>
    <p>February 25, 2021</p>

    <p><u>I have an announcement: I am experiencing motherhood.</u>
    </p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I took in a little kitten for a 1-week foster period. Of course, the one week
        passed and we were already in love with him. We named him Finnigan (Finn for short) and he is the cuddliest,
        friendliest cat I’ve ever met. (And I’ve known a LOT of cats!) </p>
    <p>Unlike most cats who prefer to be independent and left alone, Finn likes to be constantly touching someone. He
        will sit on my lap on the couch for hours on end and be perfectly content. He also refuses to sleep anywhere
        except right next to my face. His favorite spot, though, is to be nestled into my neck.</p>
    <p>You may be thinking that Finn is a boring cat who just lays around all day, but you are mistaken. Somehow, Finn
        is extremely sweet AND extremely playful. His favorite toy is this little feathered bird on a wand, and while he
        likes it for its wand properties, he also enjoys carrying the bird around in his mouth while dragging the wand
        on the floor behind him. </p>
    <p>
        Finn is a wonderful addition to our little family and keeps my boyfriend company while I’m spending long days at
        work.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will now be bombarding you with photos of Finn, my son.
