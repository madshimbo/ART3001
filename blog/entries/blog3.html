    <h1>Getting Acquainted</h1>
    <p>February 7, 2021</p>
    <p><u>Everything is new!</u></p>
    <p>These past few weeks I have been going through many changes and experiencing many new things. I’ve
    <ul>
        <li>moved to a new city with an entirely different time zone and climate</li>
        <li>started a new job</li>
        <li>started new classes </li>
        <li>learned to live with a significant other  </li>
        <li>started using new programs for school and work </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>With all of these things, I have basically had to change every aspect of my life. The core is still there, of course, but most details in my life are entirely different than they were a month ago. It is taking a while for me to get adjusted to all of these changes, and while they are exciting, I can’t help but feel a little lost when so much of who I am is now back in Ohio. </p>
    <p>I think that every other change that I’ve had in my life has been pretty gradual where one thing changes at a time and there is still an aspect of familiarity. In this case, there are some familiar things but most of my day-to-day is completely changed.</p>
    <p>I also feel that I have not had a lot of time to adjust to these changes. I have basically had to jump in to all of the new all at once and didn’t really have any time to look around and take it all in. It is just the reality now. </p>
    <p style="color:crimson;">It is especially difficult to be in the strange phase of being in school while also having a real job. Most of the time, this transition is very black and white, but for me there is a lot of gray area. On one hand, I feel like a real adult doing real job things, but on the other hand I still have to meet deadlines and complete assignments in 4 drastically different subjects. It is definitely a hard balance.</p>
