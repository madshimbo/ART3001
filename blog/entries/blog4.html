    <h1>The Balance</h1>
    <p>February 14, 2021</p>
    
    <p>Still trying to balance living a full life with all of my schoolwork. Here are some of the things I’ve done lately:
    <ul>
        <li>Toured a Fortune Cookie Factory</li>
        <li>Hiked to the beach</li>
        <li>Played with some cats </li>
        <li>Went on a run </li>
        <li>Met some coworkers for drinks</li>
        <li>Bought some books at the local bookstore</li>
        <li>Ate some good sushi</li>
        <li>Purchased a bookshelf and made a house a home  /li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Somehow, on top of living a full, chaotic, new life, I’ve still been able to do well in my classes and stay on top of (most) of my work. It takes a lot out of me at the end of the day, but so far it’s been working out. I am probably the busiest I’ve ever been, but I’m also the most fulfilled and possibly the happiest I’ve ever been. Work doesn’t always feel like work if you actually enjoy it, and I enjoy pretty much every part of my life right now, down to my job and classes and everything. </p>
    <p>I’m definitely not where I need to be yet in terms of this class and understanding everything about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but the lectures have been helpful and I am excited to hop in and learn more. It is becoming increasingly relevant to my job to have this experience as well, which is really interesting to me. The classes that I’m taking this semester all fit in to each other so well and all have to do with my new job as well. Crazy how that worked out.</p>
