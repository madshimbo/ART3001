    <h1>Starting a Garden</h1>
    <p>March 7, 2021</p>

    <p><u>It all started with one pack of seeds...</u>
    </p>
    <p>I went to my favorite corner store, Cole Hardware, to pick up a screwdriver one day. I left with far more than
        just your everyday Phillips head, however. I picked up my first packet of seeds, just for fun. Nothing wrong
        with adding some sugar snap peas to your life! </p>
    <p>Since that fateful day, I’ve been back to the store too many times to count and I can really feel my green thumb
        starting to develop. I now own a proper shovel, a watering can (shaped like an elephant), and a bunch of colored
        pots. I am realizing how much I like having greenery around me. I am now up to 4 outdoor plants and 3 indoor
        plants, and I can assure you that these numbers will only continue to grow. </p>
    <p>In my outdoor vegetable garden, I am growing: <br>
        • sugar snap peas <br>
        • carrots <br>
        • squash
    </p>
    <p>
        Stay tuned for garden updates. Heck, maybe I’ll start my own gardening blog now that I know how!
