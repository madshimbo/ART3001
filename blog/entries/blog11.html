    <h1>Endings?</h1>
    <p>April 1, 2021</p>

    <p><b>It has recently come to my attention that things will be <u> ending </u> soon.</b>
    </p>
    <p>I think one of my hardest goodbyes is going to be my student organization, The Undergraduate Business Women’s Association (UBWA). This organization has provided me with so much: a community, new friends, confidence, professional experience, and the ability to lead.</p>
    <p>I joined UBWA my freshman year of college, as an undecided business student who had no idea about anything business-related. My first year I just came to meetings, sat in the back, and absorbed all the knowledge I could. I loved all the speakers that came into meetings and I loved the free pizza. I kept coming back to soak up the seemingly infinite knowledge this org provided me with. </p>
    <p>My sophomore year, I was taken under the wing of an underclassman. She was assigned to be my mentor in the mentorship program and helped me through business problems and helped inspire confidence in me. She was the one who urged me to become more social in UBWA and eventually, run for the executive board. </p>
    <p>
        As someone who hated public speaking, running for exec was very nerve-racking. I had to get up in front of everyone and give a speech. Crazy stuff. I ended up getting on the E-board and was slotted into the VP of Corporate Relations position. My junior year I got very involved with the org, making friends, attending everything, and handling responsibility on the executive board.
    </p>
    <p>
        The organization became a huge presence in my life. As much as I loved it, it was taking up a lot of my time and effort. I told myself that my senior year, would pull back and be less involved. Hahahaha. The Senior Vice President of the organization urged me to pursue her role, and because no one was running for it, I was basically placed into it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Senior year, UBWA became my everything, especially with everything being virtual. UBWA became the entirety of what I looked forward to. It is my community, the place I feel most comfortable and accepted, and it is where I have now made so many meaningful relationships. As Senior Vice President, I am the one who organizes and leads all of the weekly meetings. I coordinate speakers, set up topics, create the powerpoints, present the powerpoints, order merch for the organization, and help the President in keeping the rest of the executive board in check. In a world of zoom meetings, this has been the only one that I never dread going to. The atmosphere that we’ve built in this meetings is so amazing and everyone can feel it. We’ve created a community of empowered women who strive to support each other always, and lift each other up as we climb. There is zero competition and we are always trying to find new ways to grow and help each other grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I reflect on my four years in UBWA and the relationships I’ve been able to make, I am extremely grateful. Joining the org was definitely the best decision I made in my college career, and without it, I would be down 4 jobs, a ton of friends, and a whole bunch of confidence. As I look ahead and begin to enter the “real world,” I am extremely sad that I will most likely not find another community like this in my adult life. Of course, I’m thankful for the time I’ve gotten, and I will also be bringing so many of the relationships I’ve formed with me.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other night, I led my last normal general body meeting and I didn’t even realize until after it was over. Once I realized, it really hit me. I will be graduating and leaving this organization for good. Since then, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and want to cherish all of the time I have left with UBWA. This will be a hard goodbye, but definitely for good reasons.
