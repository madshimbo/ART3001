    <h1>LIFE UPDATE</h1>
    <p>March 11, 2021</p>
    <p><u>Work! Life! Graduation?</u></p>
    <p>Not a whole lot to write about recently. I’ve written about this before, but I am probably the busiest I’ve ever been. Working my job, having classes, leading my organization, and attempting to have a personal life on top of all that is quite the feat.
    </p>
    <p>Because of that, there hasn’t been a whole lot of time to stop and think. It seems like the weeks just keep flying by. My plants are growing, my cat is getting bigger, I’m becoming more comfortable at my job, and we keep inching closer and closer to graduation.
    </p>
    <p>I always thought graduation would be a bigger deal to me than it seems to me right now. I think at this point I already feel like I’ve left OSU, so an online ceremony is not going to provide me with much closure. The huge change in my life was the giant move across the country, not receiving a piece of paper. I’ve already said my goodbyes and gotten my last college moments in. Now I’m living a real adult life working but still have this strange virtual class side as well.
    </p>
    <p>I’m not sure at this point if I will even attend the graduation ceremony. Maybe I’ll buy a cap and gown and go take pictures in front of the Golden Gate bridge and treat myself to some cake. That sounds like a better fit to me.
    </p>
