    <p>The end of my college experience is approaching, and I can’t help but be excited to close this chapter of my life. I absolutely loved college when we were in-person, but lately it has just been draining me and taking away from other parts of my life. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy what I’m learning in all of my classes. The projects, homeworks, and endless Zoom meetings are just getting to be exhausting in conjunction with my student org and my job. I just feel like I can’t fully commit myself to my job while I have these other commitments. I want to take on more and start to really develop my skills at work, but my demanding academic calendar prevents this.
    </p>
    <p>I’m mostly excited to apply what I’ve learned in my classes this semester to my job. I’m taking this class, a CSE Software Requirements class, and an Information Systems class that deals with GitLab. All of these concepts will tie in so nicely to my upcoming project, which is a redesign of the company’s help center. I will play a large role in planning and implementing this new website, so all of this information I’ve learned will be so valuable. It is just frustrating that I cannot yet put all of my energy into this. 
    </p>
    <p>While I’ve had such a great time at OSU and been a part of some incredible things, it does feel like it’s time to move on. I am very excited for what’s ahead and cannot wait to have more balance in my life. Thanks for reading! :)
